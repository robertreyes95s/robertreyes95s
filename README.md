Hello! My name is Robert. 

I'm currently working as a Jr. Linux Sys Admin for a company that builds awesome robots!

I love coding and working with linux and other new tech. I'm currently learning how to be a linux/python guru

I hope to be employeed as a software engineer in the near future or a devops engineer. I also wouldn't mind being a linux systems engineer!

This is some tech I'm currently studying:

1. HTML/CSS
2. Python
3. Ansible
4. Linux
5. SQL

I'll be posting some hopefully awesome projects on this account. We shall see :)
