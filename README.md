Hello! My name is Robert. 

I'm currently working as a Linux System Admin for a compnay that builds awesome robots. I'm studying to be a software engineer or devops engineer. This repo is a base for all my projects and practice code, it also may have a few random test code here and there. I love python and am currenlty also learning Golang.
